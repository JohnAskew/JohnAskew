# 🔹 README.md   

## 🧩 Overview
This repository showcases work samples with **Oracle, DB2 UDB, and Exasol** databases.  
It demonstrates **enterprise-level administration, performance tuning, and automation techniques** that improve reliability, scalability, and query efficiency in mission-critical systems.

As a **Senior Database Administrator and Python Developer**, I built these solutions to support high-availability environments across analytics, finance, and logistics workloads — maintaining uptime above **99.95%** and cutting manual intervention time by more than **60%** through automation.

---

## ⚡ Key Highlights
- **Performance Tuning** – SQL and Python utilities to monitor, optimize, and benchmark query execution.  
- **Database Automation** – Scripts and cron-based processes to streamline backups, user provisioning, and monitoring.  
- **Error Recovery Tools** – Automated job restart routines and audit logging for high-reliability systems.  
- **Integration Scripts** – Data loading and ETL automation examples integrating Exasol with Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server.  
- **Monitoring Dashboard** – Prototype metrics pipeline using Python + Grafana for database health tracking.
